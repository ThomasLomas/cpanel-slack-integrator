# cPanel Slack Integrator

This will perform basic integration between cPanel and Slack using slash commands.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a slack slash command and POST it to the URL where web/index.php resides
2. Run `composer update` being sure to fill in all of the parameters accurately. The token is from slack when you make the slash command.
3. Try the command in your slash chat (you can use slackbot to test)
